Docker
The Docker Zipkin project is able to build docker images, provide scripts and a docker-compose.yml for launching pre-built images. The quickest start is to run the latest image directly:

docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
Java
If you have Java 8 or higher installed, the quickest way to get started is to fetch the latest release as a self-contained executable jar:

curl -sSL https://zipkin.io/quickstart.sh | bash -s
java -jar zipkin.jar

connect zipkins to rabbitMQ
